-TailwindCss
-Chatgpt
-Scrimba Turtorial


### What I learned

I learnt about local storage which i evetually didnt use 
instead i opt for the 
```js
window.location.href=`success.html?email${encodeURIComponent(email)}`
```
am yet to get a hang of it , I needed it to be able to use the email i obtain from one js file in another , which worked ,same purposei needed the local storage for.

then to retrive it on the needed js
```js
  let queryString = window.location.search
  let urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString)
  let email = urlParams.get("email")

```

Javascript is really challenging and fun ðŸ¥³ ..... though stressful and frustrating ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜ª
I will keep practising till i get a firm hold of it

### Continued development

As a web developer, it's essential to take the time to master JavaScript before diving into frameworks. Rushing through the language may lead to a shallow understanding and difficulties down the road. By focusing on JavaScript fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and navigating the JavaScript ecosystem, you'll build a strong foundation for your career and set yourself up for success in both JavaScript and any frameworks you choose to learn. Remember, patience and a deep understanding of JavaScript will ultimately accelerate your growth as a developer.
